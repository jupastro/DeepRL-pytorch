# DeepRL-pytorch

There are several files in the folder based in the RL-2nd Coursework and competition from the ICL.
* The `agent.py` file contains the definition of the deep learning implementation to solve the random dungeon that is generated.
* The `random_environment.py` creates a particular dungeon that challenges the algorithm to learn how to move through it. 
* The `train_and_test.py` file is the main one to start with by executing it we get the particular dungeon and observe how the model is trained and learns how to behave.
